# Clustering-Basics

In unsupervised learning we're finding patterns in data.One of the main unsupervised learning techniques is called clustering. We use clustering when we're trying to explore a dataset, and understand the connections between the various rows and columns. 

Clustering algorithms group similar rows together. There can be one or more groups in the data, and these groups form the clusters.
